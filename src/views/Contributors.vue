          <a class="link">Grace Yang</a> is currently a student at Colby College as an English and
          Art double major. It was through a program at Colby and her interest in the company that
          she met Gianluca Rizzo, a professor at her school and one of the heads of this project,
          and soon began working with him as a research assistant. This position gave her the chance
          to have a closer look at a variety of projects, this artificial poem project being one of
          them. Grace worked to contribute to this project alongside the other students by helping
          train the AI by being the reviewers of some of its first projects and providing it with
          feedback.
